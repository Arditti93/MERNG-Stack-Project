# A Social Media App Using The MERNG-Stack

A social media app using MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node (the MERNG stack). Implemented with GraphQL and Apollo server, that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database to fetch and persist data to a social media app back-end.

A work in progress and I hope to finish and deploy this app in the next few weeks
